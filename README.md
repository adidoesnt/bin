# aditya/bin
this is a collection of useful binaries that I use locally.

# notes
for a script to run, you must mark it as executable.
this can be done using the following command:
```
$ chmod +x <script>
```
please not that the scripts here **do not** use `.sh` extensions.

# categories
## git
1. `git-add-alias`: add a new git alias
2. `git-dbe`: delete git branches except those specified
